Main Function to run:
	python blog_stats_main.py -data ../data/blog-gender-dataset-clean.csv [-n 10]

See blog_stats_main.py comments for info on how to run/print each set of stats


In short:
	1. aggregate_stats.py 
		- cleans/condenses blog data and returns aggregated word counts and simple statistics on words, returning them in a dictionary
	2. blog_stat_helpers.py 
		- a cleaning function for trimming words (removing punctuation, etc..)
		- a condensing function for combining words with similar words (i,im,i'm --> FIRST_PERSON, etc..)
	3. blog_stats_main.py
		- main function to run
	4. possessive_stats.py
		-runs a short function printing possessive words found. Didn't get too much out of this, but there's definitely more to explore
	5. punctuation_stats.py
		-tracks/prints punctuation frequencies across male/female posts. Another that didn't immediately yield too much information but could definitely be expanded upon
	6. term_stats.py
		-computes statistics for common words (using cleaning/condensing from the helper methods) across the blog posts. This immediately yielded interesting results. By finding the % of occurance of some words (or groups of words) it became visible that first person words are more common in female blog posts. 
		-TODO: apply a z-score and determine statistical significance of findings
