Main Function to run:
	python blog_stats_main.py -data ../data/blog-gender-dataset-clean.csv [-n 10]

See blog_stats_main.py comments for info on how to run/print each set of stats


In short:
	1. aggregate_stats.py 
		- cleans/condenses blog data and returns aggregated word counts and simple statistics on words, returning them in a dictionary

	2. blog_stat_helpers.py 
		- a cleaning function for trimming words (removing punctuation, etc..)
		- a condensing function for combining words with similar words (i,im,i'm --> FIRST_PERSON, etc..)

	3. blog_stats_main.py
		- main function to run

	4. possessive_stats.py
		-runs a short function printing possessive words found. Didn't get too much out of this, but there's definitely more to explore

	5. punctuation_stats.py
		-tracks/prints punctuation frequencies across male/female posts. Another that didn't immediately yield too much information but could definitely be expanded upon.

	6. significant_word_stats.py
		-a trial to see how certain words may be significant in gender discrimination. This opens the txt file produced by term_stats.py (seen below)
		-creates a new file consisting of gender,blogpost with the blog post being a bag of  words deemed significant by term_stats.py  

	7. term_stats.py
		-computes statistics for common words (using cleaning/condensing from the helper methods) across the blog posts. This immediately yielded interesting results. By finding the z-scores of word frequency in male and female blog posts, and taking the male:female ratio of these, a measure of word significance has been computed.

		-writes the significant words to a file "significant_word.txt" in the data folder. For good results, a relatively large amount of significant terms should be recorded, so that each blog post will have at least a few significant terms

		Usage:
		python term_stats.py -data ../data/blog-gender-dataset-clean.csv -n 1500
		(use lower n for more readable printout, recommended to comment out printing for n=1500)

		-decides significant by z-score ratio of word frequency between male and female blog posts. This is definitely the most variable/experimental piece of the program, and one that could certainly be tuned for better results.
